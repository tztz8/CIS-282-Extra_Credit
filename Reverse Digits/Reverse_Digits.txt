Write a method called "reverse_digit" that takes an integer as an argument and returns the number with its digits reversed.
For example, the value of reverse_digit(12345) is 54321.
You are NOT allowed to use string methods, (ie. Reverse) in the solution.
This solution must be arithmetic based - no converting the number to a string or array, etc.

No arrays, hashes,
